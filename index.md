## Idir BOUMBAR

**PhD student @ ISAE-Supaéro & IMT Mines Albi**

I am a Ph.D. student at ISAE-Supaéro and IMT Mines Albi-Carmaux, both affiliated with the University of Toulouse. My research focuses on innovative approaches involving the joint application of constraint programming and knowledge compilation. My work addresses industrial product configuration problems. I am under the supervision of Elise Vareilles (ISAE-Supaéro) and Xavier Lorca (IMT Mines Albi), but i also work with Paul Gaborit (IMT Mines Albi) and Hélène Fargier (ANITI).

I graduated from IMT Mines Albi in 2021 as a multi-disciplinary engineer, combining expertise in fundamental sciences, technical training, and management/finance. During my studies, I had the opportunity to take an exchange semester program at Mississippi State University in the computer science department. I also did an internship at CEA on the use of NLP for crisis management.
